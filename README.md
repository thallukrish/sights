## Usage

### Track a Product

Start tracking an Amazon product by providing its URL:

python price_tracker.py track https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5WRWNW
```

The tracker will fetch the current price and save it to the price history.

This will display:
- Current price

- Recent price changes
- Buying recommendations

### List Tracked Products

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: When you track a product, the tool fetches the current price from Amazon
2. **Storage**: Price data is stored locally in JSON format with timestamps
3. **Analysis**: The tool analyzes price history to identify trends and patterns
4. **Insights**: Based on historical data, it provides recommendations on buying decisions

## Price History Storage

Price data is stored in the `price_history/` directory as JSON files, one per product (named by ASIN). Each file contains:
- Product information (title, URL, ASIN)
- Complete price history with timestamps
- Currency information

## Tips for Best Results

- Track products regularly (daily or weekly) to build a comprehensive history
- The more data points collected, the more accurate the trend analysis
- Use the insights to identify the best time to purchase

## Privacy & Data

- All data is stored locally on your machine
- No data is sent to third-party services
- Amazon's robots.txt and Terms of Service should be respected

## Limitations

- Requires active internet connection to fetch prices
- Amazon's page structure may change, affecting price extraction
- Rate limiting may apply if checking too many products too quickly
- Some products may have multiple price variations (used, new, etc.)
